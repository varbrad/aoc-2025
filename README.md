# Advent of Code 2025

## Run a specific day

To run a specific day's solution, use the `-day` flag followed by the day number. For example, to run the solution for Day 1, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go run ./src -day 1
```

This will execute the code for Day 1 and display the results for both parts of the challenge.

## Benchmarks

To run the benchmark suite, use the following command:

```bash
go run ./src -bench
```
